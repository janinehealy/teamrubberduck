Sprint 1: Trello here - https://trello.com/b/V5JIkNyE

OVERVIEW
Schools often have large populations of students, in some countries over 5000 and it can be challenging to keep track of all of their information. Administrators need to manage each studentâ€™s timetable details, their reward, and conduct information. Sensitive information also needs to be tracked. That data would include family trees, admissions and census information, discipline records, special educational needs information, detailed health records such as dental, eyes and hearing, vaccinations, BMI and medical notes. There is too much information and a more streamlined process is needed for the management of student records. In this simulation, all information so far has been tracked using paper files. This web application is the first of its kind to help organize this data.

PURPOSE
This application focuses on the enrollment of students. It aims to facilitate the administration of student accounts to effectively Create, Read, Update and Delete student information. It will allow the student enrollment process to be more streamlined, resulting in an efficient operation. The application will support features such as:

- Quickly add or update student records
- Quick search of the student database
- Secure login for the administrator
- All student information to be on one page, including any related documents
- Clean, to the point user interface

BUSINESS QUESTIONS

- HOW would the application improve the overall administration process?

- WHAT value will it provide to the school and wider community?

- WOULD parents access the information through it?

- HOW do users find us? (How would they be able to access the link to the portal)

- DO we have emergency information for 100% of the students?

- DO we have disability information on all students?

- DO we have the contact information of all students?

- ARE all students enrolled in their respective courses?
